Exploring the features of Core Java and Easiness in creating GUI Application with JAVAFX.

Here I would like to present my desktop application-Internet Download Manager(IDM) clone using concept of Multithreading of JAVA as an Logic to have multiple downloads
at a time and have used JavaFX for view of our application bu using Schene Builder to create FXML files in it.

This IDM allows to enter the downloadable URL link and then it downloads the required file and stores in local folder where the path has been specified. Along 
with downloading file, it has features like Status of Download as (Downloading or Downloaded or Failed), Percentage of downloaded from total file size and an Action to directly
OPEN the downloaded file from Application

Advantage of this GUI app is that it ablility to download file in faster way compared to browser downloader. Along with that it can download multiple files on one go.
